Cant sleep, so next project: quick one (i hope), which is stm32 usb module. I am searcing for parts, right now i see STM32H7B0RBT6 as good mcu candidate. MCP1726-3302E/SNVAO as max 1A LDO cuz of buck 5v-3.3V 600mA+ cost. TPS73618QDCQRQ1 as 1.8V LDO, max 400mA, cheap.

6:19AM
Going to try to sleep, gn reader!

7:14AM
Couldnt sleep so came back, ive chosen few parts in bed as well, ESD diodes will be RCLAMP0502BATCT for CC and D pairs, one per. SMA6L5.0A/TR13 will be for vbus. 10155435-00011LF as port

8:10AM
Connected everything except pins 17-48 on schematic, will continue later

8:21AM
10 minute break and we are back again

8:54AM
Connected everything on schematic! Now pcb, but first i will count up schematic connection + part picking time spent.

Schamtic connection + part picking time spent: 104 minutes

9:13AM
Quick break for food

9:28AM
Came back, but will make longer break rn

10:09AM
Came back for wiring

10:40AM
Wired some, now break

15:22PM
Was wiring from when i sent message to channel #blueprint on hackclub's slack, so 11:33AM, but took some toilet breaks, didnt exactly journal, so lets say i was wiring from 12:00PM, now i finished. Exported footprints and symbols also so i can upload it to github. Will try it on VM if it boots with only these libs.

15:50PM
Finally set up virtual box to work, setting up windows on it to test it if it works without my libs

4:18PM
VirtualBox froze up, checked it in kicad 9 where i have nothing added as i use kicad 8, it works
